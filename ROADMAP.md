# Kubewarden Roadmap Strategy

Kubewarden utilizes GitHub Issues and Milestones to manage its development roadmap.
This dynamic approach ensures that the roadmap remains current and accurately reflects ongoing work,
avoiding the pitfalls of static documents like `MILESTONES.md`.

The roadmap is a collaborative effort, and we encourage community members to contribute by opening issues or commenting on existing ones.
The Kubewarden core team actively monitors these discussions and will incorporate relevant feedback into the roadmap.

## Milestones

Kubewarden's roadmap is organized into a GitHub milestone, which represent specific release of Kubewarden.
Each GitHub milestone is associated with a set of issues that are planned for completion within that release.
These milestones are not fixed and can evolve over time, it's common for items to shift between milestones based on development progress, testing outcomes, and community feedback.

The Kubewarden team aims to deliver a new release approximately every four weeks, maintaining a consistent and predictable development cadence.

## Issues

High-level issues are tagged with the `kind/epic` label.
These issues represent significant features, enhancements, or tasks that the Kubewarden community aims to address.
Subtasks, smaller issues, and pull requests reference these primary epic issues to provide context and track progress toward overarching goals.
